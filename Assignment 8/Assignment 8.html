      <main><p>A video game, also known as a computer game, is an electronic game that can be interacted with using an input device, such as a controller, keyboard, or joystick. Video games can be used for entertainment and relaxation, but they can also be used for competitions and for computer learning.Video game narratives are a unique type of storytelling that allows for a lot of diversity. A good narrative has a player-character dynamic and an interactive world for the character. The video game experience is subjective, so different people may have different ideas about what makes a great video game.

<p>The first video games were designed in the 1950s and 1960s by computer scientists on mainframes and minicomputers. The first consumer video game hardware was released in the early 1970s, and the first home video game console was the Magnavox Odyssey.Video games are typically categorized according to their hardware platform, which traditionally includes arcade video games, console games, and computer (PC) games; the latter also encompasses LAN games, online games, and browser games. More recently, the video game industry has expanded onto mobile gaming through mobile devices (such as smartphones and tablet computers), virtual and augmented reality systems, and remote cloud gaming. Video games are also classified into a wide range of genres based on their style of gameplay and target audience.

          <p>Video games are a global industry worth $100 billion, and nearly two-thirds of American homes have at least one person who plays video games regularly.Today, video game development requires numerous interdisciplinary skills, vision, teamwork, and liaisons between different parties, including developers, publishers, distributors, retailers, hardware manufacturers, and other marketers, to successfully bring a game to its consumers.The video game market is also a major influence behind the electronics industry, where personal computer component, console, and peripheral sales, as well as consumer demands for better game performance, have been powerful driving factors for hardware design and innovation.</p>
