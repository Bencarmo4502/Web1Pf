         Design can be a thankless job. It is also kind of a kind of invisible job in a lot of ways. People don’t realize that it is all around them every day and even more than that, not many people consider that someone actually created all the design they use, see, and generally take for granted.We no longer live in the world of MadMen where people are in awe of our profession. We truly have much more important jobs than just selling junk people don’t need. Unfortunately, the majority of mankind fails to see that without a designer somewhere, whether sitting in their home office, all alone as the sole designer for a company, or in a room full of other designers at an advertising firm, that their everyday lives would have zero visual direction. Without designers, street signs and road signs would be impossible to read, all those trendy shirts everyone buys would be plain solid colors (or just plain white).Then there’s the people who think all we do is make stuff pretty. Basically they think we do the grown-up equivalent of coloring all day long and get paid to do it. Whether people understand or value what we do, the fact remains that we have really important jobs as designers. But there is there so much more that goes into our designs and it’s our job to explain to our client the true value of what we do.

<section id="My Graphic Design Point of View">
    My thought of Graphic Design is that we have talent and skills because we done art and technology stuff back in elementary-high school and it's supposingly help us throughtout our skills of learning and giving knowlegde to do things. Growing up, I didn't like art and computer because it was hard and not fun, but once I got used to it and used more often, I enjoy it and learn so many new things. When I was in high school, I had the knowledge and skills of doing art things and computer stuff because as a graphic designers, I want to learn how to use colors, text, and more. Even if it's hard anfd it takes time to get this process learning, it will still be successful and be achieve this goal. In the future when I graduate, I want to help out the companies brand and make their life easier, but also support the others.
