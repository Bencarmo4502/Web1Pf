        <p> "Design can be a thankless job. It's kind of a kind of invisible job in a lot of ways. People don’t realize that it is all around them every day and even more than that, not many people consider that someone actually created all the design they use, see, and generally take for granted. We truly have much more important jobs than just selling junk people don’t need. Unfortunately, the majority of mankind fails to see that without a designer somewhere, whether sitting in their home office, all alone as the sole designer for a company, or in a room full of other designers at an advertising firm, that their everyday lives would have zero visual direction."</p>

        <p> My thought of Graphic Design is that we have talent and skills because we done art and technology stuff back in elementary-high school and it's supposingly help us throughtout our skills of learning and giving knowlegde to do things. Growing up, I didn't like art and computer because it was hard and not fun, but once I got used to it and used more often, I enjoy it and learn so many new things. When I was in high school, I had the knowledge and skills of doing art things and computer stuff because as a graphic designers, I want to learn how to use colors, text, and more. Even if it's hard anfd it takes time to get this process learning, it will still be successful and be achieve this goal. In the future when I graduate, I want to help out the companies brand and make their life easier, but also support the others.</p>
