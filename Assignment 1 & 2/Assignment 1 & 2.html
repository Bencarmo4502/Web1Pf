      <h1>My Thoughts about the Story</h1>
      <main>After Reading the whole story about "404 Page Not Found", it was very interesting because of how she explains so many histories and what social media was like, how coding and everything else remains. Also some bios about kate wegner when she was born and what was life like with the technology. Even though, it wasn' like there was some good parts or excited things there was in the story, but it was still good bio stories and how it attached to me of websites, technologies and more.

      <h1>Kate Wegner Info</h1>
      <main>When Kate wegner started logging into the websites and starting using internet, she starting working with the modern tune of infamous atonal tone. Her purpose of opening internet was to try using the persitent questions she had and how to manage the websites. She was the digital native and discovers how analog directory became a google. It was interesting because when I first used googles, it was very intriguing and curious how it works and looking things up. After that, she later talks about apps, wifi and etc how different it was back then and towards this day, we still use apps, wifi and more but more technology and have efficient daily life for everyday.It was also included how disembodied computers were used back in the day ancient-like, facebooks and tweets were used back then, the artifacts of internet and many more she included how it was used.</main>
      
      <h1>My Thoughts about Me</h1>
      <main>After reading the whole story of kate wegner, it got me very interesting because it was very unique and how cool it was technology back then different towards now. When i was little, my two older brothers were using computers back then and the computer was more like mobile, websites different, the screen and quality is different and how it's used everyday life. As time passed, i began to use more internets and apps from mobile phones, because also phones were different back then. It was very nostalgic because kate probably experienced more of these back then more than myself. One thing caught me was "facebook vs. tweets(and Russian Grandmothers)" that talks about how she struggle the hideous -beautiful old internet and the cleanly of godly 2.0 variety in mids-200s. I remember when I started  using facebooks, snapchats and more social media, I got bit of feeling that it wasn't going right for me but after my friends started using the social medias and internet thats when I got used to liking the sources and websites. Finally, when it talk about, "One white teen, for instance, called Myspace a “ghetto,” and another described Facebook as “the place where the ‘honors kids’ got together and discussed how they were procrastinating over their next AP English essay.", it got me thinking how was social media were used for helping classes and stuff? When i noticed we also used facebooks and other internets websites for looking up stuff of sources, info and more to help our daily life of school, work and other business.</main>
      
      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <main>To conclude this, I realize that internet and websites are more important in daily life because it helps me understand and learn more using it for my school, work and other business. It help me use more internets and keeping my life same when back then, it was different and more nostalgic for some. Especially if kate used internets and how different it was, I still think it's necessary but also used for special occasionally. Kate Wegner help me learn that websites and internets are used more daily life and how google was created and we can use google for necessary, but also the lesson we can change for internet to continue evolve. </main>
