              <p>Deja vu is is the phenomenon of feeling as though one has lived through the present situation before.It is an illusion of memory whereby—despite a strong sense of recollection—the time, place, and context of the "previous" experience are uncertain or impossible.Approximately two-thirds of surveyed populations report experiencing déjà vu at least one time in their lives.The phenomenon manifests occasionally as a symptom of seizure auras, and some researchers have associated chronic/frequent "pathological" déjà vu with neurological or psychiatric illness.Experiencing déjà vu has been correlated with higher socioeconomic status, better educational attainment, and lower ages.People who travel often, frequently watch films, or frequently remember their dreams are also more likely to experience déjà vu than others.</p>

      <h1>My Experience As Deja Vu</h1>

              <p>My Deja Vu experience was really crazy and cool that it made me think, was this real or not? There was one time where I dream about me driving in the street at night and experience different reality of where I live in real life and most of the people who I know don't recognize or some think I look familiar but don't really care. It felt super weird until I woke and it happen later the same day except different experience where I do live and most people recognize me from the streets or places I go. Also the time where as childhood, I would dream about going to fun place or birthday party until it felt like it was different alternate reality and most friends who I know don't recognize or seems like I look familiar to someone else until back to reality, it happen again except they recognize me, have good time and talk to them. There's a lot of experience I had before but I really didn't believe it or care until I experience it more and got used to it. </p>
