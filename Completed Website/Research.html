      <h2>Facts about Deja Vu</h2>
      <p>Scientists believe that deja vu is where the brain momentarily misinterprets a new situation as familiar, often linked to theories about dual processing or subtle environmental cues triggering a sense of recognition, even if the experience is new; research often focuses on studies exploring the relationship between déjà vu and brain activity, memory function, and individual differences in susceptibility to this phenomenon.This study investigated whether people who frequently experience déjà vu show distinct patterns in standard memory tasks, finding no clear correlation between déjà vu frequency and performance on recognition memory tests, suggesting a more complex mechanism at play.Researchers often use techniques like fMRI to examine brain activity during déjà vu experiences, looking for patterns in regions associated with memory and recognition. Studies also explore how factors like age, personality, and stress levels may influence the frequency of déjà vu experiences.</p>

      <h2>Memoriam</h2>
      <h2>Emile Boirac 26 August 1851 – 20 September 1917) was a French philosopher, parapsychologist, promoter of Esperanto and writer. </h2>
      <p>Boirac was born in Guelma, Algeria. He became president of the University of Grenoble in 1898, and in 1902 president of Dijon University. A notable advocate for the universal language, Esperanto, he presided over its 1st Universal Congress (Boulogne-Sur-Mer, France, 7 August to 12 August 1905) and directed the Academy of Esperanto.

He was one of the first to use the term "déjà vu", where it appeared in a letter to the editor of Revue philosophique in 1876, and subsequently in Boirac's book L'Avenir des Sciences Psychiques, where he also proposed the term "metagnomy" ("knowledge of things situated beyond those we can normally know") as a more precise description for what was, then, commonly known as clairvoyance.

He was one of a group that conducted experiments on the Italian medium Eusapia Palladino. He also investigated animal magnetism, and various hypnotic phenomena such as the induction of sleep, "transposition of senses", "magnetic rapport", "exteriorisation of sensitiveness", "exteriorisation of motor nerve force" etc.
          
          He also  included the sensation of déjà vu. Déjà vu has been presented by Émile as a reminiscence of memories, "These experiments have led scientists to suspect that déjà vu is a memory phenomenon. We encounter a situation that is similar to an actual memory but we can’t fully recall that memory." This evidence, found by Émile Boirac, helps the public understand what déjà vu can entail on the average brain.
          
          He quoted "Our brain recognizes the similarities between our current experience and one in the past ... left with a feeling of familiarity that we can't quite place."

Boirac died in Dijon in 1917.</p>
